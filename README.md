# GoMoto.io

This is setting up the GIT


##### Capstone Proposal


- Your proposal must be in a markdown `.md` file [more info](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
- 
- Your proposal must cover all major topics we've covered
- Your proposal must include the sections below


## Project Overview

GoMoto.io is a way to quickly assess and sort dirt bikes according to what aspects you care about most. GoMoto takes your weighted inputs for characteristics of dirt bikes that you have weighted as higher importance; compares and prioritizes these characteristics, then sorts and displays the dirt bikes in the order that's best for you.

Your proposal must set specific and attainable goals

What are the major features of your web application? What problem is it attempting to solve? What libraries or frameworks will you use?

## Functionality

Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

## Data Model

What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.

## Schedule

Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
