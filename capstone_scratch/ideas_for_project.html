<!--scrape data from https://www.autoevolution.com/moto/ for the following list of bikes-->
<!--[honda, ktm, yamaha, kawasaki, suzuki, aprilia, beta, husqvarna, sherco, gas gas, apollo, maico, SSR, alta (electric dirt bike)-->
<!--save that to my db-->
<!--allow inputs from the user to allow them to give ratings (weights between 0-1)-->
<!--give the user back a rating of the bikes based on those weights -->
<!--any data not given a weight will be sorted and valued by the 'best' e.g. lightest weight > heavier, lower cost > higher cost-->
